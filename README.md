# creating-DL-method-to-predict-Breast-Cancer
A PyTorch-based deep learning model was developed to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign. After preprocessing and scaling features, a neural network with two hidden layers was trained using ReLU and sigmoid activations. The model achieved 96.5% accuracy, showing strong potential for clinical diagnosis support.
